# Checklist

ðŸŸ¨Use Terraform
ðŸŸ¥Use Makefile
ðŸŸ©Setup Jenkins for CI/CD
ðŸŸ¨Build AMI using packer
ðŸŸ¥Build a BASE AMI that is used to build all other AMIs
Whenever a new base AMI is released (built), other AMI builds are triggered automatically
ðŸŸ¨Use lambda function to check source AMI and trigger Jenkins pipelines
ðŸŸ¨Create EFS: as persistant data storage, store source code or app data permanently

ðŸŸ¥App (3-tier model)
Flask API
user-data: Auto mount EFS
Run Docker Compose
Use Boto3, pandas(export CSV)... to export non-compliance security groups (Webpage > Click a button > List URLs to download CSV files)
ðŸŸ¥Store CSV lists to DB
App pipelines:

- Build Docker image â†’ ECR
- ðŸŸ¥ Use SonarQube to scan Docker image
- ðŸŸ¥ Deploy new app version
- ðŸŸ¥ Patching with new base AMI

ðŸŸ¨Tagging resources with required tags
Group: CyberDevOps
Environment: development

ðŸŸ¨AWS Config:
Rule to check tag compliance
Rule to check SG rule compliance
ðŸŸ¨SNS: send monitoring alerts (CPU, memory, disk)
ðŸŸ¨DNS (Route53)
ðŸŸ¨ALB
ðŸŸ¨ASG
ðŸŸ¨RDS
ðŸŸ¨S3 (CSV files)
ðŸŸ¨Encrypted with KMS key

### Notes

- Jenkins seedjob flow: JCasC -> Seed Job -> External Job DSLs -> Job groovy scripts
- Terraform ECR Public gets `400` cannot delete if it has images, but can delete whole registry using console

- https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/#:~:text=two%20instances%20communicate%20using%20public%20IP
- yum mirrors may deny access from some regions like `seoul`, best to use `sydney` or `singapore`
- AWS's AMI has package mananger source set to AWS's own mirror, which will cost REGIONAL DATA TRANSFER as opposed to using public mirrors, which is free inbound: https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/17s1jsd/comment/ksui2rn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

#### Mock Latest AMI Route
- Use an S3 static website

#### Lambda AMI Check
- EventBridge rule triggers Lambda function at some interval
- Lambda check for compare the lasest AMI-ID with the current one (stored on SSM Parameter Store)
- If new AMI-ID is found, trigger Jenkins job to build new AMI and update the SSM Parameter Store

#### EFS + DockerCompose?
- UserData Script to clone github repo and run docker compose -> Pull and run image from ECR
- Docker compose mount EFS volume to store data/logs??? =>Not as good as CloudWatch Logs
```yaml
# Example
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: my-web-app:latest
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@my-rds-endpoint:5432/mydatabase
    volumes:
      - efs:/var/www/html
